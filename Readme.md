# Amiibo Database
This is a javascript library showing the entire Amiibo database collection. Amiibo is Nintendo's line of toy-to-life figurines that can be used to unlock features in many Nintendo games.

We are using an external API https://amiiboapi.com/

Features we hope to implement in the future:
1. Search bar to filter through all the Amiibos
2. Wishlist feature to save Amiibos someone wants to collect
